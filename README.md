A machine learning project to predict flight delays with an interactive web interface.
DEMO---  https://flightdelaypredictor.streamlit.app/

Flight delays are one of the biggest operational challenges in aviation.
This project predicts whether a flight will be delayed by 15+ minutes, using a trained Random Forest model and a clean Streamlit web app.

Users can input flight details like:

Airline
Origin Airport
Destination Airport
Departure Hour
Distance
Date (Month, Day, Day of Week)

The app returns:
✔ Probability of Delay
✔ ON TIME / DELAYED classification
✔ Simple & clean UI for end users

🎯 Key Features

✔ Machine Learning Model trained on 3,000+ flight samples

✔ 8 engineered features including DepHour & airline encoding

✔ Automatic label encoding for airlines & airports

✔ Interactive Streamlit frontend

✔ Lightweight & Cloud-friendly requirements

✔ Fully deployable on Streamlit Cloud
